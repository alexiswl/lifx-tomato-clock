# LIFX Based Tomato Clock

Based off the following Python packages
[![Python package CI tomato-clock](https://github.com/coolcode/tomato-clock/workflows/Python%20package/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/coolcode/tomato-clock/actions)
[![PyPI version tomato-clock](https://badge.fury.io/py/tomato-clock.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tomato-clock/)

LIFX Tomato Clock is a simple command line pomodoro app.
25 mins on with bright light, 5 mins on with red light

## Installation

```
$ git clone https://github.com/coolcode/tomato-clock.git
$ cd lifx-tomato-clock
$ python3 lifx-tomato.py 
```

### LIFX Access token
Please read this [authentication page first]('https://api.developer.lifx.com/docs/authentication')
Create the folder `~/.lifx`. Change the modifications to 700 so that no one else on your computer can read it.
```bash
mkdir --mode=700 ~/.lifx
```
Then add in a file to this directory named 'lifx.yaml' and update accordingly.
You may copy the file in `templates` for convenience.

```
$ cat ~/.lifx/lifx.yaml
access-token: <insert access token here>
groups:
  <name of your work room>:
    id: <group id>
    name: <group name>

```

### Getting the credentials for the above yaml file:
Head to the [LIFX API ENDPOINTS PAGE](https://api.developer.lifx.com/docs/list-lights) and head down to 'Try It Out'.  
Insert 'all' into the selector page and your access token as the authorization key.  
Click 'Try it' and head to the 'group' section.  
`<group id>` should become the value under `group` -> `id`.  
`<group name>` should become the value under `group` -> `name`.  
`<name of your work room>` itself is arbitrary and can be named to something convenient.  


## Terminal Output
```
üçÖ tomato 25 minutes. Ctrl+C to exit
 üçÖüçÖ---------------------------------------------- [8%] 23:4 ‚è∞ 
```

## Light Output:

Focus mode: Light will turn white and 100% for 25 mins
Stretch mode: Light will turn red with 100% saturation for 5 mins

## Future work
* Allow for returning light to previous state prior to pomodoro invocation.
* Allow for skipping current break or starting break early.
* Allow for customised light settings, or for preferences to be set in yaml file.
